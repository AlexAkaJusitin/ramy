        God’s Glory Departs From the Temple 10 I looked, and I saw the likeness
        of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of
        the cherubim. 2 The Lord said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among
        the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from
        among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he
        went in. 3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the
        temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 4 Then
        the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the
        threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was
        full of the radiance of the glory of the Lord. 5 The sound of the wings
        of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the
        voice of God Almighty[a] when he speaks. 6 When the Lord commanded the
        man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the
        cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel. 7 Then one of the
        cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took
        up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it
        and went out. 8 (Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what
        looked like human hands.) 9 I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four
        wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz.
        10 As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like
        a wheel intersecting a wheel. 11 As they moved, they would go in any one
        of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn
        about[b] as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction
        the head faced, without turning as they went. 12 Their entire bodies,
        including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full
        of eyes, as were their four wheels. 13 I heard the wheels being called
        “the whirling wheels.” 14 Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face
        was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third
        the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 15 Then the
        cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the
        Kebar River. 16 When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved;
        and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the
        wheels did not leave their side. 17 When the cherubim stood still, they
        also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them,
        because the spirit of the living creatures was in them. 18 Then the
        glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple and
        stopped above the cherubim. 19 While I watched, the cherubim spread
        their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went
        with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord’s
        house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 20 These were
        the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar
        River, and I realized that they were cherubim. 21 Each had four faces
        and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands.
        22 Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar
        River. Each one went straight ahead.

        To Boddah
        <br />
        Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would
        rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be
        pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101
        courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we
        say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your
        community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of
        listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing
        for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things.
        For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic
        roar of the crowds begins., it doesn't affect me the way in which it did
        for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and
        adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy.
        The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to
        you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by
        faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as
        if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've
        tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe
        me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have
        affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those
        narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too
        sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms
        I once had as a child. On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better
        appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of
        our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and
        empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I
        simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking
        sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why
        don't you just enjoy it? I don't know! I have a goddess of a wife who
        sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of
        what i used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets
        because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me
        to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought
        of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that
        I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the
        age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only
        because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only
        because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess. Thank you all
        from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and
        concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I
        don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out
        than to fade away. Peace, love, empathy. Kurt Cobain Frances and
        Courtney, I'll be at your alter. Please keep going Courtney, for
        Frances. For her life, which will be so much happier without me. I LOVE
        YOU, I LOVE YOU!

        <p>We're alone togheter, or so I think. I've tasted a lot of experience which I shouldn't have acquainted, but that is life, I can't change my past nor I can't change the memories that are stuck in my head and keep me up at night. I know a lot of people are misunderstood, judged,  <strong>rejected.</strong>It's sad, it makes me cry, this fucking stupid life that we live in and everyone is so uncaring about it.Everyone only sees themselves, not the people around them. I created this forum for people to talk to each other, people with problems, people without problems that just can't do something because of different things in their life. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks that some people are taking away their lives even thought something can be done.
        <br>
        I want to change something about this world, this is my fight to make humans that deserve better have a better life.
